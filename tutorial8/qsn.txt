1. What are the key differences between Merge Sort and Quick Sort, and in what scenarios would one be preferred over the other?

2. How does Dijkstra's algorithm ensure the shortest path in a weighted graph, and what are its time complexity and practical applications?


4. Compare and contrast Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) in terms of their traversal methods, time complexity, and typical use cases.

5. Describe the working principle of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). What types of problems is SVM best suited for, and how does the choice of kernel function affect its performance?
