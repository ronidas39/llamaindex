In the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber security, intelligent chatbots are gaining prominence. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing empower these chatbots to handle user inquiries and deliver threat intelligence. This helps cyber security knowledge readily available to both professionals and the public. Traditional rule-based chatbots often lack flexibility and struggle to adapt to user interactions. In contrast, Large Language Model-based chatbots offer contextually relevant information across multiple domains and adapt to evolving conversational contexts. In this work, we develop IntellBot , an advanced cyber security Chatbot built on top of cuttingedge technologies like Large Language Models and Langchain alongside a Retrieval-Augmented Generation model to deliver superior capabilities. This chatbot gathers information from diverse data sources to create a comprehensive knowledge base covering known vulnerabilities, recent cyber attacks, and emerging threats. It delivers tailored responses, serving as a primary hub for cyber security insights. By providing instant access to relevant information and resources, this IntellBot enhances threat intelligence, incident response, and overall security posture, saving time and empowering users with knowledge of cyber security best practices. Moreover, we analyzed the performance of our copilot using a two-stage evaluation strategy. We achieved BERT score above 0.8 by indirect approach and a cosine similarity score ranging from 0.8 to 1, which affirms the accuracy of our copilot. Additionally, we utilized RAGAS to evaluate the RAG model, and all evaluation metrics consistently produced scores above 0.77, highlighting the efficacy of our system.\\n\\nKeywords: Large Language Model, Security Chatbot, Threat Intelligence, Cyber Security, Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\n\\n## 1 Introduction\\n\\nThe rise of interconnected technologies creates new vulnerabilities, leading to a surge in complex cyber threats and demands a faster response to security incidents. So, having some intelligent-based tools like chatbots that can provide threat intelligence about the current landscape is crucial. The chatbots\\n\\nempower cyber security professionals by efficiently answering their queries and keeping them informed about the evolving threat landscape [1]. Chatbots are computer programs that mimic human-user conversation through text or voicebased communication [2]. Earlier researchers utilized techniques, such as rulebased or knowledge-based, to implement the chatbot [3]. The rule-based chatbot operates on a set of predefined rules and patterns. However, rule-based systems are not very flexible, and they could have trouble answering complicated or unclear questions and, therefore, do not learn from user interactions [4]. To process user input and provide appropriate responses, chatbots make use of technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP).\\n\\nThe emerging landscape of human-computer interaction and NLP has entailed the development of chatbots based on the Large Language Model (LLM). Unlike traditional rule-based or other chatbot systems, LLM chatbots deliver refined and contextually relevant information to the users. The proficiency of this chatbot extends to tasks such as language comprehension, sentiment analysis, and generating logical responses across various domains [5,6]. Additionally, they offer scalability, effectively handle diverse user queries and adapt to evolving conversational contexts [7]. Recently, security organizations have employed chatbots to explore cyber incidents happening in the real world [8]. A cyber security chatbot is an AI-powered conversational agent designed to assist organizations in addressing cyber security related inquiries, incidents, and concerns [9]. Security chatbots provide instant support to users, ensuring timely resolution of issues irrespective of temporal constraints. The chatbot frees up valuable human resources, allowing cyber security professionals to focus on more strategic actions and threat mitigation efforts. The chatbot's round-the-clock availability goes beyond the limitations of human support staff, guaranteeing uninterrupted assistance to users worldwide. It helps to reduce the search time for cyber security engineers by providing instant access to relevant information, solutions, and resources, optimizing the troubleshooting and resolution of security incidents.\\n\\nThis paper looks into the architecture, implementation, and advantages of an advanced cyber security chatbot named IntellBot, empowered by cutting-edge technologies such as LLM and Langchain.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5163, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.9162547588348389), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='843da89e-c786-4dab-aa62-5fd239b62282', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='4bd580af-2b88-4c01-8c55-e15f027b0b73', node_type='4', metadata={}, hash='4a458e9b64bc3d1f73d8be6c4f8a0c0355d10098d43ca76384ff195dafbf9850'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='841c6a53-ccb5-4ecf-9c68-843581ddcc3c', node_type='1', metadata={}, hash='882b38ca2c3cb3d64e7dcb59a63ba9eddc65cd3c65a1122081bb3f965c5d175c'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='dd298174-0e3e-49fe-beee-3527acb16fea', node_type='1', metadata={}, hash='6fc53ac8d5319580db0611a5febd96febf9526da38b3eb5c49c13514f37d6542')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"Recently, security organizations have employed chatbots to explore cyber incidents happening in the real world [8].

This chatbot offers cyber security insights and advice, benefiting not only security experts and organizations but also the general public. By providing easily accessible information and resources, it helps users to take proactive measures to protect themselves and their organizations from cyber threats. The efficiency demonstrated by the chatbot results in cost savings by reduced manual intervention and time saved by delivering quick and accurate responses to inquiries.\\n\\nThe major contributions of this paper include:\\n\\n- -We compile a security knowledge base from diverse sources, including APT reports, security books, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), security blog articles, and reports from threat intelligence platforms. Our dataset encompasses a total of 2,447 PDF documents, consisting of 445 cyber security books and 2,002 Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) reports. Additionally,\\n\\nwe gathered 7,989 details of malicious file hashes from Virustotal, storing the responses in JSON format. Furthermore, we compile 2,959 URL details. Moreover, we gathered 1,97,256 vulnerability details and scraped 21,825 security blog contents, all saved in CSV format.\\n\\n- -We develop an AI-based cyber security copilot by integrating the comprehensive security knowledge base with cutting-edge Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities.\\n- -We evaluate the performance of IntellBot by a two-stage approach. Initially, we analyzed the performance through an indirect approach, in which the BERT score is calculated between the user query and five bot-generated questions from the response to the query. In the second stage, we measure the cosine similarity between the bot-generated responses and human responses for the same query using Word2Vec, Glove, and BERT embeddings.\\n\\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 dives into related research findings, Section 3 explains the background for the study, Section 4 outlines the methodology employed in this study, Section 5 showcases the experimental results, including the interface and IntellBot output, Section 6 concludes the work and proposing future research directions.\\n\\n## 2 Related work\\n\\nLarge language models excel in various NLP tasks, including creative text generation, translation, and question answering [10]. These AI models, empowered by massive amounts of text data, offer versatility due to their ability to handle unseen data and require less task-specific training than traditional models. Notably, LLMs are advantageous when data scarcity is a concern. However, finetuned models may still be preferable for tasks with abundant data. While LLMs hold significant promise, real-world applicability, interpretability, and potential biases remain challenges. A few research works are available in the state of the art, integrating NLP and LLM for chatbot creation.\\n\\nIn [11], the authors proposed an approach for using chatbots to improve communication between citizens and government. The chatbots help to understand citizens' queries and provide them with information or complete transactions. Pandya et al. [12] introduced Sahaay, an open-source system that uses LLM to automate customer service. Sahaay directly retrieves information from a company's website and leverages Google's Flan T5 LLM to answer customer queries. The model is further trained with Hugging Face Instructor Embedding to improve its understanding of meaning. Looking to address the limitations of traditional, inflexible methods in entrepreneurship education, a new study [13] proposed a groundbreaking solution: an LLM chatbot acting as a startup coach simulator. This system tackles the iterative nature of startup development by leveraging a conversational interface powered by LLMs like GPT-3. They created the chatbot to provide real-time feedback on crucial aspects like their business model, product-market fit, and financial projections. In [14], authors proposed an LLM-based chatbot for the Fintech industry. They integrated technologies,\\n\\nincluding Langchain, to enhance response accuracy and relevance. Initial findings suggest a positive impact on user knowledge regarding the Digital Tenge project.\\n\\nOliveira et al.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=4039, end_char_idx=9353, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.909899115562439), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='1202292b-f892-4eca-afe1-6e9cc69c5129', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='4bd580af-2b88-4c01-8c55-e15f027b0b73', node_type='4', metadata={}, hash='4a458e9b64bc3d1f73d8be6c4f8a0c0355d10098d43ca76384ff195dafbf9850'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='9984889b-6eb3-4475-b923-844ea0fe8cab', node_type='1', metadata={}, hash='f1a67ff8de0d57297f516b2331cae37d1bc443bc29567932d8aab5b8158cd0ec'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ce9670bb-e138-4069-8002-d3c10ef07d15', node_type='1', metadata={}, hash='837c09fb97a8553f831659b0910f7b57e2b0e2d65f356e466c3d6d06cad1aa43')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='## 5.1 Response Evaluation\\n\\nIn this section, we provide a detailed overview of the query responses received from our chatbot. Also, we evaluate the response using a two-phase approach with bot-generated answers and manual responses.\\n\\nInitially, we developed the IntellBot using the process presented in Section 4. Then we tested various queries with IntellBot related to vulnerabilities, attacks, malware, and campaigns. For instance, one inquiry focused on versions of packages that are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via Email validation, to which the bot accurately responded with package forms before 1.2.1, from 1.3.0, and before 1.3.2. Similarly, we investigated queries related to Taidoor attacks, finding that attackers used a compromised commandand-control server in China, along with other compromised machines, for their infrastructure. They employed tools like MS-SQL attack tools, CNC programs, and FTP servers for these attacks. Subsequently, we evaluated the responses generated by IntellBot and assessed their performance using the two approaches discussed in Section 4.8. To do this, we generated 100 questions from each type of document and queried the IntellBot to obtain answers.\\n\\nResponse Evaluation Using Bot-generated Questions: In this step, we generated five bot questions from each query responses. Then we calculated the BERT score between the initial query ( Q$\\\\_{0}$ ) and each of these five generated questions ( { Q$\\\\_{i}$ } 5 i $\\\\_{=1}$) as described in Section 4.8. Subsequently, we determined the average similarity score.\\n\\nTable 1 presents a sample of questions, their corresponding responses, the five bot-generated questions for the response, their BERT scores, and the average BERT score. From the table, we observed that the BERT score between the initial query ( Q$\\\\_{0}$ ) and the bot-generated questions ( { Q$\\\\_{i}$ } 5 i $\\\\_{=1}$) is consistently very high, nearly 0.91 on average. This indicates that the generated questions closely match the content of the initial query.\\n\\nWe also analyzed all query responses by this method and our analysis reveals that the average BERT score exceeds 0.80 for all Q$\\\\_{0}$ and the bot-generated questions { Q$\\\\_{i}$ } 5 i $\\\\_{=1}$. So, based on our indirect proof statement discussed in 4.8, the bot-generated response is correct for the specific query. This finding suggests that IntellBot consistently provides accurate and relevant responses to the questions posed, reinforcing its effectiveness in generating appropriate answers.\\n\\nTable 1: BERT Score (BS) comparison between the initial query ( Q$\\\\_{0}$ ) and five bot-generated questions ( { Q$\\\\_{i}$ } 5 i $\\\\_{=1}$).\\n\\n| Query                                                          | IntellBot Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Five Bot Questions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | BS                |   Average BS |\\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|\\n| Who were the primary victims targeted in the Mirage campaign?  | The primary victims targeted in the Mirage campaign were organizations involved in the contest for rights to survey natural gas and oil in the South China Sea, including a high profile oil company in the Philippines, a military organization in Taiwan, an energy company in Canada, and organizations in Brazil, Israel, Egypt, and Nigeria. | What is the Mirage campaign and who were the primary tar- gets? 0.921 How were the organizations in- volved in the contest for rights to survey natural gas and oil in the South China Sea affected by the Mirage campaign?

The IntellBot utilizes the LangChain framework, which enables the architecting of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems with numerous tools to transform, store, search, and retrieve information that refines language model responses. Combining LLMs with vector databases highlights the potential for intelligent information retrieval systems tailored to cyber security. We assessed the IntellBot performance using a two-stage approach. Initially, we analyzed performance through an indirect method by calculating the BERT score between the user query and five bot-generated questions from the response to that query. In the second stage, we measured the cosine similarity between the bot-generated responses and human responses for the same query using Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT embedding. Our findings show that in the first stage, we achieved a BERT score greater than 0.8 and consistently obtained cosine similarity scores ranging from 0.8 to 1, indicating highly accurate query responses. Also, RAGAS\\'s evaluation metrics, consistently above 0.77, highlight the system\\'s effective performance across various types of cyber queries. In the future, we plan to integrate more data sources to enhance the chatbot\\'s capabilities and expand its relevance in cyber security contexts. Moreover, we intend to incorporate more evaluation techniques to comprehensively assess the chatbot\\'s responses. Additionally, we plan to leverage reinforcement learning with human judgment to refine and optimize the bot\\'s responses.\\n\\n## Acknowledgment\\n\\nThis work was partly supported by the HORIZON Europe Framework Programme through the project \"OPTIMA-Organization sPecific Threat Intelligence Mining and sharing\" (101063107), funded by the European Union.

When the user encounters a cyber security issue and poses a query, the chatbot analyzes this context alongside the user\\'s specific query.\\n\\n## [System]\\n\\n\"You are a cyber security expert.

Streamlit proved highly advantageous in creating an interactive interface with minimal coding requirements, seamlessly aligning with our data processing framework, LangChain. We used Streamlit version 1.32.2, where it provides a chat\\\\_input function to feed the user queries.\\n\\n## 4.8 Response Evaluation\\n\\nAfter developing the IntellBot for querying security related questions, we need to evaluate the accuracy of its responses. To assess the performance of the bot, we propose a two-stage evaluation approach. Initially, we assessed the correctness of our IntellBot\\'s responses to a query by generating five bot questions based on the retrieved response. We then validated the correctness of the response through indirect proof. Subsequently, we strengthened the evaluation by providing manual answers to the questions and comparing them with the bot\\'s response using similarity scores.\\n\\n## Step 1: Response Evaluation using bot-generated questions\\n\\nIn this stage, we employed an indirect proof strategy. We determined the bot answer A to the cyber security query Q$\\\\_{0}$ and generated five subsequent bot questions Q$\\\\_{1}$,Q$\\\\_{2}$,...,Q$\\\\_{5}$ based on A . The validation process involved comparing these generated questions with the original query Q$\\\\_{0}$ to assess the correctness of A .\\n\\nThen, we applied indirect proof or proof by contradiction, which asserts that assuming a statement\\'s opposite leads to a logical inconsistency. It relies on the following logic: If the bot answer A was incorrect, the questions { Q$\\\\_{i}$ } 5 i =1 derived from A would logically diverge from Q$\\\\_{0}$ . However, if the similarity score, sim ( Q$\\\\_{0}$,Q$\\\\_{i}$ ) , is high for all i (ranges from 1 to 5), it contradicts our initial assumption of A \\'s incorrectness. This contradiction suggests that A correctly addresses Q$\\\\_{0}$ .\\n\\nThis approach proceeds as follows:\\n\\n- -Assumption : Initially we assume that bot generated answer A to the initial query Q$\\\\_{0}$ is incorrect.\\n- -Implication : If A is incorrect, the subsequent questions { Q$\\\\_{i}$ } 5 i =1 generated by the bot based on A should not similar to Q$\\\\_{0}$ .\\n\\n- -Proof : The process begins with computing the BERT score between Q$\\\\_{0}$ and each { Q$\\\\_{i}$ } 5 i =1 to quantify their semantic alignment. BERT score computes similarity scores between pairs of texts using contextual embedding from Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Higher BERT score values indicate stronger semantic coherence between the texts, suggesting a closer alignment in meaning and context. We calculate the average BERT score across the set of questions { Q$\\\\_{i}$ } 5 i =1 generated by A . If this average BERT score yields high values when compared to Q$\\\\_{0}$ , it implies significant semantic similarity between Q$\\\\_{0}$ and the bot-generated questions { Q$\\\\_{i}$ } 5 i $\\\\_{=1}$.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=24959, end_char_idx=29539, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.8958520889282227)]\n"
